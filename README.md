# Text_Mining_IS7036


This is an individual project for Data Mining for Business Intelligence wherein I have demonstrated Text Mining using Python.

The aim here is to perform some text mining analysis on the last words of people who were on death row in Texas to identify common themes in the things they say. This will help us understand what really matters to a person minutes before their imminent death and gives us a different perspective the way we look at our own lives.
